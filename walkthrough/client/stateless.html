    <h2>Just Render Given Data Out</h2>

        <p>
          Try to keep as many of your components as possible stateless. By doing this we'll isolate the state to its most logical place and minimize redundancy, making it easier to reason about our application.

    <h2>Component Pattern</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
          A common pattern is to create several stateless components that just render data, and have a stateful component above them in the hierarchy that passes its state to its children via props. The stateful component encapsulates all of the interaction logic, while the stateless components take care of rendering data in a declarative way.
