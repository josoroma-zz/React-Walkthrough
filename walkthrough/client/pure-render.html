    <h2>Functional Stateless Component</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
          A simple component, that isn't stateful, can be provided as a single
          function that accepts props. This provides React with a hint that this
          component can be collapsed and that its state doesn't need to be preserved.
          It also encourages micro-componentization instead of custom helper functions
          outside the system.
