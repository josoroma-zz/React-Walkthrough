    <h2>ES6 Classes</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
          React already lets you do this on the component composition level instead of the method composition level. Let the parent component wrap the child component, and thus get the ability to specify its own lifecycle methods.

    <h2>State Initialization</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
          The React team decided a more idiomatic way of initializing state was simply to store it in an instance variable setup in the constructor. This means we can refactor away our `getInitialState` method by moving its return value to be assigned to the `this.state` instance variable in our class' constructor.
